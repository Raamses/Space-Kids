# Workflow: Idea Laboratory

## Step 1: Creative Brainstorming
**Agent:** Nova (UI/UX) + Cosmo (Content)
- Take the user's initial idea and expand it into 3 distinct "Toddler Interaction" concepts.
- Ensure concepts align with the "NASA Cinematic" aesthetic in @global-kids.md.

## Step 2: Technical Feasibility
**Agent:** Orion (Architect)
- Evaluate which concept is most performant for mobile/Three.js.
- Define the data schema needed (e.g., new JSON entries for spaceship parts).

## Step 3: Safety & Compliance Check
**Agent:** Guard (Security)
- Review the concepts for "Toddler UX" risks (e.g., "Is this too complex for a 3.5-year-old?").
- Check for potential data-privacy concerns.

## Step 4: The Pitch
**Agent:** Master Orchestrator
- Present the 3 concepts as a "Feature Pitch" Artifact.
- **Stop and Wait:** Do not create a plan until the user selects a concept.
